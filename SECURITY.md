# Security Policy

If you find a security vulnerability, **do not** open a public Issue.

- **Contact:** skull@ttl.zip
- **Disclosure window:** 90 days by default (faster if actively exploited or high impact).
- **Scope:** This repository and published release artifacts (including installer scripts/binaries).

## Reporting guidelines
Please include:
- Affected commit or release version
- Impact and severity (e.g., RCE, privilege escalation, information disclosure)
- Steps to reproduce (PoC), environment details
- Any known mitigations or workarounds

We will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**, provide a tracking ID, and keep you updated on triage and remediation timelines.

## Out of scope (examples)
- Issues requiring privileged/local admin access without a clear privilege escalation path
- Vulnerabilities in thirdâ€‘party dependencies without a demonstrable exploit path in this project
- Social engineering, physical attacks, or spam

## Supported versions
We provide security fixes for the **latest release**. If you rely on older versions, please upgrade to the newest release.

Thank you for helping keep users safe.
